# WallFollowingRobot
Simple Continuous Servo Controlled Wall Following Robot

This idea was originally implimented as an arduino community college project. This version will use an STM32L0 micro controller instead of the arduino, it will also use custom 3D printed parts instead of the acrylic peices of the original robot frame.
